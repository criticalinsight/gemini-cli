Claude Code Gemini CLI is a premium, open-source AI agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal. It combines the powerful agentic philosophy of Claude Code with the state-of-the-art intelligence of Google's Gemini models. It understands your codebase, iterates on designs, and autonomously implements features.

Learn all about Gemini CLI in our [documentation](https://geminicli.com/docs/).

## 🚀 Why Gemini CLI?

- **🎯 Free tier**: 60 requests/min and 1,000 requests/day with personal Google
  account.
- **🧠 Powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Access to 1M token context window.
- **🔧 Built-in tools**: Google Search grounding, file operations, shell
  commands, web fetching.
- **🔌 Extensible**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for custom
  integrations.
- **💻 Terminal-first**: Designed for developers who live in the command line.
- **🛡️ Open source**: Apache 2.0 licensed.

## Why Claude Code Gemini CLI?

This project is a premium evolution of the official Gemini CLI, designed to bring the **agentic workflow philosophy** of Anthropic's Claude Code to the Google Gemini ecosystem.

### Improvements over Official Gemini CLI

- **Agentic Workflows:** Beyond simple chat, use `claude-gemini feature-dev` to let the AI plan, execute, and verify entire features autonomously.
- **Design Doctor (Auto-Fixer):** If your build or tests fail, the AI automatically detects the error, proposes a fix, and verifies it until it works.
- **Local Persistence:** Complex multi-turn workflows are saved locally. You can stop and resume agentic tasks at any time without losing context.
- **Deep IDE Context:** Automatically pulls context from your VS Code or Antigravity workspace (open files, selections, cursor position) for hyper-relevant responses.
- **Advanced Tools:** Full support for `grep`, `glob`, `shell`, and `mcp` servers, allowing the agent to interact with your environment like a real engineer.

### Comparison with Anthropic Claude Code

| Feature | Official Gemini CLI | Claude Code (Anthropic) | Claude Code Gemini CLI |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Model** | Gemini | Claude | **Gemini** |
| **Agentic Tool-Use** | Basic | Advanced | **Advanced** |
| **Auto-Fixing** | No | Yes | **Yes (Design Doctor)** |
| **Resume State** | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| **OS Support** | Cross-platform | Cross-platform | **Windows Optimized** |
| **IDE Companion** | Basic | None | **Rich Integration** |

> [!NOTE]
> While Claude Code is highly optimized for Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, this tool brings that same high-agency experience to **Gemini 2.0 Flash/Pro**, offering a powerful alternative for developers within the Google Cloud/Vertex ecosystem.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Basic Usage

#### Start in current directory

```bash
claude-claude-gemini```

#### Include multiple directories

```bash
claude-gemini --include-directories ../lib,../docs
```

#### Use specific model

```bash
claude-gemini -m claude-gemini-2.5-flash
```

#### Non-interactive mode for scripts

Get a simple text response:

```bash
claude-gemini -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase"
```

For more advanced scripting, including how to parse JSON and handle errors, use
the `--output-format json` flag to get structured output:

```bash
claude-gemini -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase" --output-format json
```

For real-time event streaming (useful for monitoring long-running operations),
use `--output-format stream-json` to get newline-delimited JSON events:

```bash
claude-gemini -p "Run tests and deploy" --output-format stream-json
```

### Quick Examples

#### Start a new project

```bash
cd new-project/
claude-gemini> Write me a Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

#### Analyze existing code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
cd gemini-cli
claude-gemini> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```
